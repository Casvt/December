# December

An automatic file transcoder following the rules you set.

## Workings

Set up processes for media and subtitles files that will be applied to all files entering the queue. It's up to you how much or little you want to do. December even supports automatically adding files to the queue after they've been downloaded using Radarr or Sonarr, and has integrations with Bazarr and Plex. A plugin system is available so that you can even write or download custom actions.
